Set
===

A set is an abstract data type that stores values without any particular order
and with no repeated values. It is the mathematical concept of a finite set.
Unlike other collections, it is more often used to test for membership of a value
and not to retrieve a value.

Sets can be implemented with various other data structures like trees or hash
tables, which have different time and space trade-offs. They often have methods
like `add`, `delete`, and `isMember` (or similar), ignore sort order, and avoid
repeated values.
