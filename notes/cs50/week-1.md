## Part 1

#### C
Starting with code like:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

To turn this code into software that is executable, a program called a compiler
is used. It converts source code to object code, or 0s and 1s that a computer
can read.

#### Writing Code
`#include <stdio.h>` gives access to a library or a collection of function
previously written so the wheel doesn't have to be reinvented, which includes
functions like `printf`.
