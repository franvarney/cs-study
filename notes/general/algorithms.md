## Introduction

### What is Algorithm?

Informally, algorithms are a well-defined sequence of steps that takes some values (input) and returns some values (output) after some specific calculation(s).

The words "algorithm" and "algorism" come from the name al-Khw훮rizm카. Al-Khw훮rizm카 was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar.

### Example

One problem of sorting a set of elements in ascending or descending order can be defined formally as an algorithm as follows:

_Input_ : A sequence of _n_ numbers < a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... a<sub>n</sub> >

_Output_ : A permutation < a<sub>1</sub>',  a<sub>2</sub>', ... a<sub>n</sub>' > such that a<sub>1</sub>'<=a<sub>2</sub>'<=a<sub>3</sub>'...<=a<sub>n</sub>'

### Application of Algorithms

* The Human Genome Project uses some advanced algorithms in identifying 100,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequence of 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA and store this information in databases and retreive them and develop tools for analysis.

* The Internet uses clever algorithms in routing to allow websites to allow users to access large volumes of data without much delay.

* E-Commerce websites utilize algorithms such as cryptography to allow users to have secure transactions over the Internet.

* Manufacturing industries and enterprises use algorithms to utilize their resource properly and yield maximum profit.
