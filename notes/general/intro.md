## Introduction

### What is Algorithm?

Informally, algorithms is well-defined sequence of steps that takes some values (input) and gives out some values after calculation (output).

The words 'algorithm' and 'algorism' come from the name al-Khw훮rizm카. Al-Khw훮rizm카 was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar. 

### Example

One of problem of sorting a set of elements in ascending or descending order can be defined formally as an algorithm as follows:

_Input_ : A sequence of n numbers <a1,a2,...an>

_Output_ : A permutation <a1', a2', ... an'> such that a1'<=a2'<=a3'...<=an'

### Application of Algorithms

* The Human Genome Project uses some advanced algorithms in identifying 100,000 genes in human DNA, determining the sequence of 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNA and store this information in databases and retreive them and develop tools for analysis.

* The Internet uses clever algorithms to allow websites to allow users to access large volumes of data without much delay.

* E-Commerce websites utilize algorithms such as cryptography etc to allow users to have secure transactions over the Internet.

* Manufacturing industries and enterprises use algorithms to utilize their resource properly and yield maximum profit.
