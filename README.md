========
Practice with data structures and algorithms and other random things. I'm using
JavaScript (Node 4+), but see the next section if you want to contribute in a
different language!

## Contributing
I started this study guide to learn Computer Science concepts and while I'm
using JavaScript (since it's the language I currently know best), I'd be happy
to accept examples and solutions in other languages as well! If you want to
submit code (or notes), feel free to make a PR. If the language you're using
requires a specific version (ie Python), please make a comment at the top of
the file with the version. And, if possible, do some basic test statements
using `assert` (or similar). For languages _completely_ unfamiliar to me, I will
probably try to phone a friend to review your PR.

## Issues
Did you find a bug? Do you have a request for a specific code example
or solution? Make an issue!
